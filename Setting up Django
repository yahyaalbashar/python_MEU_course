# in this walkthrough we will demonstrate how to install and run django on your local machine

# after making sure you have python on your local machine, open the command line and do the following:

# - go to C directory as following:
# cd \
# you are supposed to be in the C directory
# create a directory and call it whatever you want:
# mkdir my_project
# cd my_project

# pip is a package management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python.
# Many packages can be found in the default source for packages and their dependencies â€” Python Package Index (PyPI).

# install virtualenv as following :

# pip install virtualenv

# virtualenv is a tool to create isolated Python environments. 
# virtualenv creates a folder which contains all the necessary executables to use the packages that a Python project would need.

# after installing virtualenv run the follwoing command in my_project directory:
# virtualenv . 
# notice that the (dot) is telling the virtualenv to create a virtual environment in the current directory which is 
# in our example my_project
# then activate the virtualenv with these commands in my_project directory:
# cd Scripts
# activate

# leave the Scripts directory like this : cd ..

# ============================================================

# now lets install django on our local virtualenv:
# pip install django
# once its succefully installed django you can start developing cool websites.



# =============================================================

# now lets create a Django project
# in my_project from the command line we need to create a django project as follwoing:
# django-admin startproject my_django_project (you can name your project whatever you want)
# the go to the directory of my_django_project like this : cd my_django_project
# now we need to migrate the sqlite databse with this command: python manage.py migrate
# after finishing migrations we need to create a super user (admin):
# python manage.py createsuperuser 
# it will ask you to specify username/email/password once your done it will display a message when it is succeful
# lets run our project by the following commands to test that every thing is ok:
# python manage.py runserver
# once it is running, open any web browser and in the url bar go to the localhost: https://127.0.0.1:8000
# a welcoming screen should appear indicating that you started the project succefully
# you can go to https://127.0.0.1:8000/admin and login using the credintials we created with the createsuperuser command
